# osu-tool #
A multitool for all things osu! (And more!)

About
-----------------
Osu!tool was made by and is updated by NaruS.

The project was started in 2018 in the month of September-However the project came to life after I realized Osu!MassExtractor would be pointless for a large group of people if I planned to release(which I didn't)

Osu!Tool allows to:
Track their and others status (Across all gamemodes: Todo
Track total



Users are not allowed to use this program for malintent. This rule goes for plugin/addon creators as well

I give you the ability to openly create plugins with this program because I trust that you, the community, can help make osu!tool better
by adding your own special touch. As of right now(9/12/18 or 12/8/18) the ability to create plugins is both not there yet, and also limited.


As of now, I only have a near goal to implement Python (.py) support for the plugins. Eventually, C#,js(javascript),and even lua 
support will be added.

I understand that C# and python can go hand in hand in hand (for example on windows making a .dll and using ctypes
to import the dll will allow use of C# code). Users may not decompile this code in order to make this change though as it goes against the rules listed above.
-- I got lazy so ill just type this up when I have time and  revisions will be constantly made
